> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment was supportive, comfortable, and easy to adapt to. Everyone was willing to help whenever I encountered technical issues—especially with AWS setup, Elastic Beanstalk deployment, or CI/CD troubleshooting. The flexible and remote-friendly environment fit well with my schedule. I think the program could add more team-sharing sessions or bonding activities to strengthen connections among interns.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provided detailed and clear guidance, especially when dealing with complex topics such as AWS architecture design, VPC networking, CI/CD pipeline setup, and .NET backend optimization. Instead of giving direct answers, the mentor encouraged me to analyze and solve problems independently, which I highly appreciate. The admin team was also very helpful with documents, logistics, and general support.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks assigned to me matched well with the knowledge I learned in school while also extending to new areas that I had never worked with before. Working with .NET 3-tier architecture, EF Core, repository pattern, SQL Server, and AWS services helped reinforce both theoretical and practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The internship allowed me to gain valuable hands-on skills, including:

- AWS cloud architecture (VPC, RDS, S3, CloudFront, WAF, NAT Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, etc.)
- Building CI/CD pipelines using CodePipeline & CodeBuild
- Designing systems following AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Writing technical documentation and analyzing software architecture

Soft skills such as teamwork, progress reporting, communication, and handling issues professionally also improved significantly throughout the program.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team culture was positive and respectful. Everyone worked seriously but was still friendly and supportive. Even during busy periods, team members helped each other without hesitation. This made me feel like I was part of the team, not just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The program provided flexibility in working hours and gave access to useful learning materials. The opportunity to work on an end-to-end real project was one of the biggest benefits, helping me build practical experience beyond what is taught academically.

### Additional Questions

- **What was I most satisfied with during the internship?**  
  The opportunity to work on a complete cloud-based system — designing architecture, deploying services, testing, and optimizing costs — was incredibly valuable.

- **What should the program improve for future interns?**  
  It would be beneficial to include more focused technical workshops (e.g., deeper VPC networking, advanced AWS configurations) or scheduled study sessions.

- **Would I recommend this internship to others? Why?**  
  Yes. Because the program offers real project experience, strong mentorship, and practical skill development that directly benefit career growth.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- Consider adding more AWS-focused workshops or hands-on labs.
- Introduce periodic demo sessions or sprint reviews so interns can learn from each other’s progress.
- Provide additional documentation or standardized AWS deployment checklists.
- If an advanced or extended internship track becomes available, I would be excited to continue participating.
