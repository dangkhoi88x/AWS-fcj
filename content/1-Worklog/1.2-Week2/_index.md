### Week 2 Achievements

- Applied **IAM** principles in practice (users, roles, and access policies).

  - Implemented least-privilege permissions and appropriate group policies.
  - Understood relationships between **users, groups, roles**, and **policies**.

- Successfully launched, connected to, and terminated **EC2 instances** within the Free Tier.

  - Managed instance lifecycle from the **EC2 Console**.
  - Verified SSH connectivity and basic instance health.

- Built foundational knowledge of **Amazon VPC**:

  - **Subnets**, **Route Tables**, **Internet Gateway**, **NAT Gateway**, and logical network design.
  - Understood routing mechanics and secure network isolation.

- Learned **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** concepts for secure connectivity between on-premises networks and VPCs.

  - Grasped VPN tunnel behavior and high-level setup steps.

- Gained hands-on exposure to **Amazon Bedrock Playground** (Claude/Titan).

  - Practiced prompt writing to obtain accurate, useful responses.
  - Explored generative AI use cases and response patterns.

- Reinforced **C# programming** alongside AWS exercises.

  - Authored small snippets to validate syntax and core logic.

- Formed a broader view of primary AWS domains:
  - **Compute** (EC2, Lambda), **Networking** (VPC, VPN), **AI/ML** (Bedrock).
  - Understood how these services combine to build end-to-end cloud solutions.
