During my internship at AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED from  29/9/2025 to 22/11/2025, I had the opportunity to work directly on a real-world cloud transformation project titled “Digital Transformation for Mini-Market on AWS Cloud”.
Throughout this internship, I applied the knowledge learned in school—software engineering, cloud computing, and system design—to build a complete .NET 3-tier e-commerce platform deployed on the AWS Cloud.

I contributed to the development of key modules in the system architecture, including:

- Designing and implementing Domain, Application, Persistence, and WebShop layers following the Repository & Unit of Work patterns

- Building core features such as product management, authentication, shopping cart, checkout flow

- Integrating AWS services including S3, RDS, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, ElastiCache, WAF, VPC, and CI/CD with CodePipeline

- Supporting the preparation of architecture diagrams, system documentation, and cost estimation

- Participating in testing, performance analysis, and deployment to the staging/production environment

Beyond technical skills, I developed communication, teamwork, documentation, and problem-solving abilities by working closely with supervisors and adapting to professional workflows.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
